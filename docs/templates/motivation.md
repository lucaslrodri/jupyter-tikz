I had been using <a href="https://github.com/jbn/itikz" target="_blank">ITikZ</a> for years. However, it doesn't update often and relies on the outdated `pdf2svg` to convert PDFs to images, which causes problems in Windows environments. Inspired by ITikZ and <a href="https://github.com/mkrphys/ipython-tikzmagic" target="_blank">IPython TikZ Magic</a>, I decided to create my own package, adding new features such as the ability to work with preambles and save the LaTeX result to IPython variables. I also switched from `pdf2svg` to Poppler, which works perfectly in Windows.
