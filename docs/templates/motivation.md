## Motivation

I had been using [ITikZ](https://github.com/jbn/itikz) for years. However, it doesn't update often and relies on the outdated `pdf2svg` to convert PDFs to images, which causes problems in Windows environments. Inspired by ITikZ and [TikZ Magic](https://github.com/mkrphys/ipython-tikzmagic), I decided to create my own package, adding new features such as the ability to work with preambles and save the LaTeX result to IPython variables. I also switched from `pdf2svg` to Poppler, which works perfectly in Windows.
