I had been using [ITikZ](https://github.com/jbn/itikz) for years. However, it doesn't update often and relies on the outdated `pdf2svg` for converting PDFs to images, which causes problems in Windows environments. Inspired by ITikZ and [IPython TikZ Magic](https://github.com/mkrphys/ipython-tikzmagic), I decided to create my own package, adding new features such as support for preambles, new Jinja syntax, and the ability to save the LaTeX result to IPython variables. I also switched from `pdf2svg` to Poppler, which works perfectly on all plataforms, including Windows.
