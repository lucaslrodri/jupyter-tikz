# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before start the installation, you should verify if the minimal dependencies are installed.

### LaTeX

LaTeX must be installed using one of the following distributions:

- [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) (All Platforms)
- [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows)
- [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (Mac)

You can test if a LaTeX distribution is installed by using the following command:

```latex
pdflatex --version
```

### Poppler

This application requires Popplerâ€™s `pdftocairo`. You must install it beforehand.

#### Conda - Platform Independent

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge poppler
```

#### Windows

Download Poppler for Windows [here](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/). You must add the `bin` folder to your [PATH](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-addedit-path-environment-variable-in-windows-11/).
